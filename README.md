# Azure Pipeline for vcpkg exports

This repository contains an Azure Pipeline for building artifacts of *vcpkg* packages using the public repository
[vcpkg-overlay](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/vcpkg-overlay-ports-public.git). This is useful for repositories that
depend on pre-built binaries of the packages.

The packages are built every night.
